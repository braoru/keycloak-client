## Basic keycloak client in go

This repo provides a basic keycloak client in go, and utilities to parse the html docs into usable schema files because I wasn't good enough to make maven give me ascii documentation. I should try again at some point. It uses swagger, so it SHOULD be doable, it was just easier at that time to write an html parser to quickly prototype something.
